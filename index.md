I am a systems/back-end/infrastructure developer with 35 years experience
in operating systems, networking, databases, software engineering, and
testing. My experience ranges from embedded systems to Unix kernel internals
to client-server desktop applications to web applications and
Hadoop applications.
I also have considerable experience with Unix-type systems administration,
configuration management, and operations, including AWS, Terraform, and Kubernetes.
